# Introduction
A program to test the performance and usability of process scheduling algorithms such as First Come First Served (FCFS), Shortest Job First (SJF) and Round Robin (RR) with overhead and without overhead.

### INSTALLATION
1. Please ensure your IDE supports C `.c` or C++ `.cpp` files so that it is able to run.
2. You can choose to run either `main.c` or `main.cpp` in your preferred IDE as both contain the same code with just different extensions.
3. If the two files above is unable to run, it is advised to copy the source code and paste it in an empty `.c` / `.cpp`  (which ever suits) file to run.
4. Do contact us at hfymw1@nottingham.edu.my if there are any problems with running the code.
